# Data-Visualisation---Exploring-a-Century-of-Olympic-Games

We have performed analysis on the Olympic Games held from 1896 to 2016. [1] Through our analysis we will uncover various trends in the Olympic games and most noteworthy trends have been presented below in the form of intuitive images and graphs. The Olympic games have been in existence for over a century, which makes it  interesting to discover the underlying patterns which can potentially describe the evolution of sports over time. Furthermore, such data can also point towards other social factors which may 
have developed or recessed since the 19th  Century.
